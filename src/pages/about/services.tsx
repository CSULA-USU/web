The Reflection room (formerly named the Mediation room.) is located on the third floor in room 302. After the 1997 renovation of the previous U-SU a local artist created a meditation art instillation in a vacant union storage space. The meditation space was very popular among students and became permanent. When the current U-SU was opened in 2008. The Muslim Student Association and the U-SU Board of Directors collaborated to create the current space. The current space is utilized by students from all walks of life and tends to get heavier usage during times of student stress and holiday seasons. The space is open free of charge during all U-SU open hours. The room needs no reservations and is used by many community members.',
