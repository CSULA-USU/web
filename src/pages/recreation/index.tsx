With open doors and minds, we provide space and opportunities enabling Golden Eagles to soar. We accomplish this by encouraging social, cultural, recreational, and educational programming for the University and broader community. We foster a vibrant and equitable campus climate. Our vision is to be Cal State LAâ€™s hub for connection and growth."
