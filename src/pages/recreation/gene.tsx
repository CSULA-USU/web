          Welcome to the Golden Eagle Nutrition Education (GENE) program! Here,
          you can sign up for personalized nutrition education sessions provided
          by our Cal State LA Nutritional Science students. Our student coaches
          can teach you everything you need to know about nutrition, plus the
          science of mindfulness and habit change. Think of your nutrition coach
          as a supportive mentor who can offer individual feedback and
          encouragement as you make food and lifestyle changes.
