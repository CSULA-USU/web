            Golden Eagle Event Krew (GEEK) is an opportunity for Cal State LA
            students to get involved behind the scenes, helping with event
            programming and/or marketing for Center for Student Involvement
            events. The volunteer program offers many opportunities to develop
            professional and leadership skills in a fun, fast-paced environment
            by working with vendors, campus administrators and CSI staff to make
            events come to life!

            breakdown, take pictures, interact with guests at events and help
            table throughout the semester. As a thank you for your service,
            GEEKS will be recognized with incentives throughout the semester!
