        As a tax-exempt organization, the University-Student Union (U-SU) must
        make the appropriate organizational documents available for inspection
        online or for copying at the organization&apos;s main office during
        normal business hours. We have made our best effort to ensure that the
        documents posted on the website are the most recent versions of the
        aforementioned documents.
