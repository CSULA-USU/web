        As a Tax-Exempt Organization the University-Student Union(U-SU) must
        make the appropriate organizational documents available for inspection
        online or for copying at the organization&apos;s main office during
        normal business hours. We have made our best effort to ensure that the
        documents posted on the web site are the most recent versions of the
        aforementioned documents.
